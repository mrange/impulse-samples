# Bonus: Straight from the book 1KiB Windows Demo

![The demo](../images/sftb.jpg)

Included here is the demo "[Straight from the Book](https://demozoo.org/productions/338146/)". Some small adoptions have been made from the released version.

Note: Because we link with CRINKLER + TINYHEADER option most Anti-Virus programs gets annoyed and prevents you from running the demo. Windows Defender allows you to register a specific folder as an exception so I have setup an exception pointing to the build directory.

Special thanks to [lhphr](https://www.youtube.com/@lhphr) for sharing the amazing formula that generates the music.

See [4KiB Windows Demo Example](../README.md) for info about tools used to make a really small executable.
